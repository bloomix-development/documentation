Commit messages are just as important as the code itself.
They are the record of **what changed, why it changed, and how**.

A clear history makes it easier to:
- Review changes in pull requests
- Track down when and why bugs were introduced
- Generate changelogs for releases
- Onboard new developers into the project

To keep our history consistent and easy to read, we follow a lightweight convention based on Angular's commit message guidelines.
This helps us understand the purpose of each change at a glance.

## Commit Message Format

Every commit should follow this basic structure:
```plaintext
<type>: <subject>
```
- `type`: The kind of change you are making (see below)
- `subject`: A brief description of the change

Keep your subject concise (around 50 characters if possible). If you need more space to explain *why*, that belongs in the commit body, not the subject line.

Below you can find a list of valid commit types and what they mean:

| Type              | Description                                                                        | Example                                                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`            | A new feature or enhancement                                                       | `feat: add route for password reset`                   |
| `fix`             | A bug fix                                                                          | `fix: handle null value in login flow`                 |
| `docs`            | Documentation changes only                                                         | `docs: update README with setup instructions`          |
| `style`           | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.) | `style: format UserService.ts with Prettier`           |
| `refactor`        | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                          | `refactor: simplify user authentication logic`         |
| `perf`            | A code change that improves performance                                            | `perf: add caching for session tokens`                 |
| `chore`           | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries                      | `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`        |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` | A change that could break current code elsewhere or harm backwards compatibility   | `BREAKING CHANGE: requires auth token`                 |

## Commit Contents
Each commit should represent **one logical change**.
Avoid mixing unrelated fixes, refactors, and features in the same commit.

This keeps history easier to follow and makes it simple to revert specific changes without dragging in unrelated code.
```plaintext
# Good (one clear change per commit)
feat: added password reset route
refactor: extract email helper into utils

# Bad (multiple changes in one commit)
feat: added password reset route and fixed email sending logic
```

## Common Courtesy
At the very least, make sure your code **compiles without errors** before committing.
You don't need to run the full test suite every time (though that's ideal), but
it's a courtesy to the next developer that the repo can be pulled and built without breaking.

This avoids wasting time chasing down obvious syntax or type errors.
Think of compiling as the *minimum bar of quality* for a commit; Testing and polishing can follow later.
We don't want to be the ones reminding you to clean your room so please do it yourself.

## Commit Hygiene
Oftentimes your IDE or OS might add some extra files to your folder, such as `.DS_Store` on macOS or `Thumbs.db` on Windows.
Please do not commit these files, as they are not relevant to the project and can cause unnecessary clutter in the repository.
If it becomes an issue we advise that you add a rule for it in your `.gitignore` file and commit that instead.

It should go without saying what should NOT be committed, but here's a quick reminder:
- **Sensitive information**: API keys, passwords, etc.
- **Build artifacts**: `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`
- **IDE-specific files**: `.vscode`, `.idea`
- **Temporary files**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`
- **Debugging files**: Logs, temporary test files
