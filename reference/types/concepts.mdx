This page is designed only for developer onboarding - it has little to no use for frontend or user-facing developers.
All the types below define the shape of data and conventions used internally.
**The vast majority of information here will be useless for you.**

## JSON Primitives
We decided on only a few set primitives to be included in JSON typings.
These are your common primitives in every language (minus `undefined` which is not a valid JSON type).
```ts
export type JSONPrimitive = string | number | boolean | null;
```

From here we can build up a more recursive and general JSON type.
```ts
export type JSONValue = JSONPrimitive | JSONValue[] | { [key: string]: JSONValue };
```

We could stop here normally as this can describe any valid JSON object, but we try to go a little bit further in our implementations.

The first of which here is to represent any JSON *object*, not just values.
Effectively all this means is that the root **must be an object** but we don't care about the rest of the structure.
```ts
export type JSONObject = { [key: string]: JSONValue };
```
And finally from there we have string representations of the above types, again only for internal purposes.
```ts
export type JSONPrimitiveStrings = 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'object' | 'array' | 'null';
```

## Endpoints
Endpoints are the core of every API to ever exist, but for that matter we wanted to put a lot of emphasis on flexibility and extensibility.
This is why we have a very simple yet powerful endpoint type.

This actually comes in several parts but we will review them separately first.

### Endpoint Methods
We only allow a few set ways to interact with the API.
Paths are of course part of the battle but the methods are the most important part.
```ts
export type EndpointMethod = 'GET' | 'POST' | 'DELETE' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH';
```
For most parts of the API we only use `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE` but we do allow for the others to be used as well.
We included a little cheat sheet below for how these methods are typically used:

| Method   | Description                                                   | Example                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `GET`    | Retrieve data from the server                                 | Fetch user profile                |
| `POST`   | Create new data on the server                                 | Create a new website              |
| `DELETE` | Remove data from the server                                   | Delete a user account             |
| `PUT`    | Update existing data on the server (replaces entire resource) | Update the *entire* user profile  |
| `PATCH`  | Partially update existing data on the server                  | Update *only specific* parts      |

### Endpoint Parameters
Endpoints can have parameters that are used to pass data to the server.
We also use these for sanity checks for your convenience in the case you typed something wrong.
```ts
export type EndpointParameters = { [key: string]: JSONPrimitiveStrings };
```
Please also note that this is a "flat" structure, meaning that it does not support nested objects or arrays.
For any nested data we must handle that separately *per endpoint*.

### Endpoint Queries
Much like the parameters, queries are used to filter out data from the server.
The big difference however is that
1) Queries do not have any type checking - That is, everything is a string.
2) Queries are only applicable to `GET` requests.
```ts
export type EndpointQueries = string[];
```

### Endpoint Responses
Responses are the data that the server sends back to the client.
This is the final step before we can put it all together.
Note that this is a free-form shape, meaning that you can return any valid JSON object.
The only requirement here is that `status` must be a `number` and defaults to `200` if not specified.
```ts
export type IEndpointReturn = {
	status? : number; // HTTP status code, defaults to 200
	[key: string]: JSONValue; // The actual data returned
};
```

### Endpoint Type
Finally we can put it all together into a single endpoint type.
This is the type that you will see in most of the API code.
```ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

export interface IEndpoint<TReturn extends JSONObject | Response | void = IEndpointReturn> {
	method: EndpointMethod; // The HTTP method for this endpoint
	route: string; // The path for this endpoint, e.g. '/users/:id'
	params?: EndpointParameters; // Parameters that must be provided in the request
	queries?: EndpointQueries; // Optional queries that can be used to filter data
	handler(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<TReturn>; // The function that handles the request
}

// example
export default {
	method: 'POST',
	route: '/users',
	params: {
		// Type checking is done automatically at runtime
		username: 'string',
		password: 'string'
	},
	handler: async (req, res) => {
		const { username, password } = req.body;

		// Perform your logic here, e.g. create a user
		const newUser = await CreateUser(username, password);

		return {
			status: 201,
			user: newUser
		};
	}
} as IEndpoint;

```
