This section documents the typings and data structures used by the website builder system.

The website builder organizes pages into a tree of **nodes**, where each node describes a distinct part of the page.
A node may represent a text block, image, button, or even a layout container that holds other nodes.

This structure allows websites to be defined as a hierarchy of small, reusable components.
Each node stores its own **data**, optional **styling**, and a **parent ID** to maintain the tree structure.
Together these nodes describe the entire page layout ina consistent format and can be serialized, persisted, and rendered later.

## Website & Page Records
Each website is given a unique internal ID and contains a list of pages.
These pages are the root of every node tree, and technically you could argue that actually the website itself is a node, but for simplicity we treat it separately.
```ts
export interface Website {
	id: number; // ID of the page, use this for intercting with the API
	name: string;
	url: string; // https://{name}.bloomix.dev
}
```

The page objects are very similar as you can see below:

```ts
export interface Page {
	id: number; // Page ID, used for API interactions
	websiteId: number; // ID of the website this page belongs to
	path: string; // Path of the page, e.g. "/about", "/contact"
}
```

## Node Types
All nodes are categorized by their **type**, represented by the `WebNodeType` enum.
```ts
export enum WebNodeType {
	CONTAINER = 0,
	TEXT = 1,
	IMAGE = 2,
	BUTTON = 3,
	VIDEO = 4
}
```

This ensures every node has a clear, unambiguous purpose:
- **CONTAINER**: Holds other nodes, forming the layout structure
- **TEXT**: Represents a block of text content
- **IMAGE**: Embeds and image with size and alt text
- **BUTTON**: Interactive element (click, submit, link, etc.)
- **VIDEO**: Embeds a video with optional poster image

It should go without much saying that these types are designed to resemble HTML elements, making it easier to understand and work with the structure. <br/>
Container: `<div>` <br/>
Text: `<p>` or `<span>` <br/>
Image: `<img>` <br/>
etc.

## Base Nodes

This is the very bare basic structure of every page on Bloomix.
We won't get into the algorithms and theories here but all you need to know is that this builds a linked list tree structure - each layer can have multiple children, and each child can have its own children, and so on.

In layman's terms: recursive node structure; many node = much complexity!

```ts
export type BaseNode<
  TData extends JSONValue, // we'll cover these later!
  TStyle = Record<string, string | Record<string, string>>
> = {
  id: number;                // Unique ID (insertion order)
  parent_id: number | null;  // null for root within its page
  page_id: number;           // Page.id that the node belongs to, allows for O(1) lookups

  /**
   * Order discrimination for same-level nodes.
   * Higher numbers render later (on top).
   * @default 0
   */
  z_order: number;

  type: WebNodeType;         // Discriminator
  data: TData;               // Node-specific payload
  style: TStyle;             // CSS-like map (may be nested)

  flags: {
    /**
     * Hide element without removing it.
     * @default false
     */
    hidden?: boolean;

    /**
     * Prevent move/resize/delete in the UI.
     * Data may still change; parent may still change.
     * @default false
     */
    locked?: boolean;

    /**
     * Disable interaction (buttons/links/etc).
     * Does not affect move/resize.
     * @default false
     */
    disabled?: boolean;

    /**
     * Whether this node can have children.
     * @default true
     */
    supports_children?: boolean;
  }
}
```

The comments above should be self-explanatory of what they do, but we'll cover them again briefly below.
- `id`: Unique ID for the node, this is assigned for you, you have no control over its value
- `parent_id`: ID of the parent node, or `null` if this is the root node of the page
- `page_id`: Associated the node with a specific page, useful when multiple pages exist in the same website
- `z_order`: Frankly this is a poorly named variable for lack of better terms. Internally this is used to differentiate loading order on the same level. This should be treated as a `y_discriminate` instead and will be changed in future releases.
- `type`: The type of the node, see the `WebNodeType` enum above
- `data`: The data payload for the node, this is a JSON value and will have a different structure depending on the node type
- `style`: A CSS-like map of styles for the node, this can be only be nested 2 layers deep (e.g. `{"color": "red", ":hover": {"color": "blue"}}`)
- `flags`: A set of flags that control the behavior of the node, such as visibility, interactivity, and whether it can have children.
  - `hidden`: If true, the node will not be rendered but will still exist in the tree
  - `locked`: If true, the node cannot be moved, resized, or deleted in the UI, but its data can still change
  - `disabled`: If true, the node will not respond to interactions (e.g. buttons or links), but can still be moved or resized
  - `supports_children`: If false, the node cannot have children, this is useful for leaf nodes like text or images

## Specialized Node Variants
As stated above, there are several specialized node types that extend the base node structure.
These types add specific data and styling relevant to their function, while still adhering to the base structure.

### Container Node
This node represents a `<div>` element in HTML, and is used to group other nodes together.
Support for flex and grid layouts is planned for the future, but currently it is a simple container.
```ts
export type ContainerNode = BaseNode<{}> & { type: WebNodeType.CONTAINER };
```

### Text Node
This node represents a block of text content, similar to a `<p>` or `<span>`
At the moment it only supports single colors and font sizes, but more styling options are planned.
```ts
export type TextNode = BaseNode<{
	text: string; // The text content of the node
}> & { type: WebNodeType.TEXT };
```

### Image Node
This node represents an image, similar to an `<img>` element.
It includes the image URL, alt text, width, and height.
```ts
export type ImageNode = BaseNode<{
	url: string; // URL of the image
	alt: string; // Alt text for the image
	width: number; // Width of the image in pixels
	height: number; // Height of the image in pixels
}> & { type: WebNodeType.IMAGE };
```

### Button Node
This node represents a button, similar to an `<button>` or `<a>` element.
Currently, these are only visual elements and do not have any interactivity.
```ts
export type ButtonNode = BaseNode<{
	text: string; // Text displayed on the button
	action: string; // Action to perform when clicked (e.g. "submit", "link", etc.)
}> & { type: WebNodeType.BUTTON };
```

### Video Node
This node represents a video, similar to a `<video>` element.
It includes the video URL, poster image, width, and height.
```ts
export type VideoNode = BaseNode<{
	url: string; // URL of the video file
	poster: string; // URL of the poster image
	width: number; // Width of the video in pixels
	height: number; // Height of the video in pixels
}> & { type: WebNodeType.VIDEO };
```

## The Union Type
For convenience, all node types are bundled into a single union type:
```ts
export type WebNode =
	| ContainerNode
	| TextNode
	| ImageNode
	| ButtonNode
	| VideoNode;
```
This makes it easy to work with collections of nodes while retaining type safety.
TypeScript can narrow down which fields are available based on the node's `type`.
