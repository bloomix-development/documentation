This page documents internal typings used across the project - Both public facing and private.
These types are used to ensure consistency and type safety and testing across the codebase.

As a note, please keep in mind [Rule #1 from the Coding Conventions](https://docs.bloomix.dev/writingContent/standards#1-null-vs-undefined): `null` is used for empty or missing data, while `undefined` should never be used.
If data is missing, **the property will always be present**.

For your convenience, we've split up this massive document into many smaller sections.
You can find the sections and their descriptions below or navigate using the sidebar on your left.

- [**Core Concepts**](https://docs.bloomix.dev/reference/types/concepts) - A lower level glance into the internal typings.
- [**Builder Types**](https://docs.bloomix.dev/reference/types/builder) - The types used by the website builder system.
